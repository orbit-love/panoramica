The Orbit Model is a framework for building high gravity
communities. A high gravity community is one that excels at
attracting and retaining members by providing an outstanding member
experience and increasing the bonds between members.

Let's see how the Orbit Model is built up from this basic metaphor and
walk through the model's high-level concepts. These are:

- **Gravity**: the rate at which member involvement is changing; measured at the community level
- **Love**: the measure of an individual member's involvement based on their presence and involvement; measured at the individual member level
- **Reach**: the measure of a member's sphere of influence
- **Impact**: the outcomes that happen thanks to the operation of the community
