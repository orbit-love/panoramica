The Orbit Model is a framework for building high-gravity communities.
It was conceived in 2014 as a tool to help community and developer relations teams
multiply and communicate their impact.
Since then it has been used by tens of thousands of organizations to be more intentional in
how they plan, organize, and scale their communities.

By origin, the model is a complement to the sales and marketing funnel. It is a new metaphor that works better
for the more intricate challenges of community building.
While the funnel has a single
goal and tries to _push_ everyone toward it, the Orbit Model recognizes multiple goals and
allows members to _pull_ themselves toward what's right for them.

The Orbit Model defines a community as both:

- i) a set of voluntary activities aligned to a common mission and
- ii) the network of relationships that emerges as people do activities together.

If you remove
either i) or ii) you can still have another arrangement of people, but it would not be a community.
By looking at the intersection between community-as-mission and community-as-network, the Orbit
Model unlocks powerful, hidden insights that community leaders can use to improve their
day-to-day effectiveness and long-term strategy.
