In today's world, products are adopted not sold. Every product company faces the challenge of getting widespread adoption.
Many startups die because they can't make the leap from a small set
of _innovators_ and _early adopters_ to the much larger _early majority_ and _late
majority_. These startups never hit the takeoff point of the technology adoption S-curve.
Even if they do, there's no guarantee that adoption will only go up, especially in competitive markets.

Why do so many businesses struggle to cross the chasm or stay there? Because adoption
as a science is not very well understood by product and company leaders. Traditional
distribution methods like marketing, sales, advertising, and social media are chosen
to drive adoption but are often ineffective. Simple products can get adoption this
way but more complex products targeted at developers, professionals, hobbyist consumers,
and business users cannot. Adoption for these products requires assessing risk, navigating
uncertainty, and gathering lots of trusted opinions from people who've previously
adopted (or chose an alternative). In today's noisy world, buyers listen to the people
they trust and are rightly skeptical of information they encounter from untrusted
sources. This is why we say that products are adopted, not sold.

**Adoption is a user and buyer-led process where information, relationships, and trust play essential roles.**
The job of modern product, growth, and community leaders is to create the context where adoption can happen.
Adoption can't be forced, it must be facilitated. It requires a plurality of disciplines, collaboration
amongst teams, and a thought-out plan for how to equip, organize, incentivize, and reward the invaluable people
who champion the product to others.

### The Orbit Model

The Orbit Model was created in 2014 and is based on a simple premise: each member of a community
orbits at a different level, their distance changing according to their involvement level or _love_. Members
orbiting at similar distances are grouped into _orbit levels_. Community builders use each member's
orbit level as a cue for what they need, who to connect them with, what they are willing to contribute,
and generally how to engage with them. The _gravity_ of a community determines how successful
it is at pulling members in to nearer orbits, and the _reach_ of each individual member measures
the size of their network and their influence on it. Unlike the funnel, the goal is not to push the most
people toward a goal, but to maintain a balance between the levels that helps the community support
all of its members and accomplish its mission.

**Today, the Orbit Model is most popular amongst developer-first and SaaS product companies where adoption is
a key challenge and reason for building a community.** To best serve these communities,
the Orbit Model has been updated to deal directly with the question of product adoption and provide
a blueprint for how to build and maintain a community that engages all of its members in the
mission of achieving adoption for the product.
