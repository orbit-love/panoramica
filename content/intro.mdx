Every startup faces the challenge of getting widespread adoption for their product.
Many startups die because they can't make the leap from a small set
of _innovators_ and _early adopters_ to the much larger _early majority_ and _late
majority_. These startups never hit the takeoff point of the technology adoption S-curve.

Why do so many startups struggle to cross the chasm? Because adoption as a science is not very
well understood by startup teams. Traditional distribution methods like marketing, sales, advertising,
and social media are employed to influence adoption but often ineffectively. Simple
products can get adoption this way but products targeted at developers, professionals,
hobbyist consumers, and business users generally cannot. Adoption for complex products requires
assessing risk and navigating uncertainty. In today's noisy world,
buyers listen to the people they trust and are rightly skeptical of information they
encounter from untrusted sources.

Many startup teams think that the way to cross the chasm is by spending all their time
making the product better. This rarely works. If some users are already happy with the
product, the bottleneck isn't features but the rate at which happy users are able to spread
the word.

So, how can startups get adoption? **By building a community.** Not just any community,
but a community designed specifically to accelerate product adoption and reward the
users who help the product grow. How can such a community be built? By using the Orbit Model.
