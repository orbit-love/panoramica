The Orbit Model is a framework for building a high-gravity community. A high-gravity
community has a strong pull that holds members in orbit around the community's mission
and values.

The Orbit Model was created in 2014 by developer advocates and community builders. The creators
of the model had observed that community teams were being asked to
use the sales and marketing funnel to create their strategy and prove the ROI of their actions.
This felt wrong. It encouraged community builders to become more transactional at the cost of the
quality and loyalty in their community. It made conversations between community builders and
company leadership difficult.

The Orbit Model was conceived as an alternative to the
funnel. With the funnel, the objective is to get the highest number of people to reach a single goal. With
the Orbit Model, the objective is to balance the number of people at different engagement levels
and grow the love and reach of each member, resulting in a community that is effective at achieving its
mission and capable of growing sustainably. A high-gravity community, as we like to say.

## The broadest definition

Today, the Orbit Model is popular amongst developer-first and SaaS product companies, both
startups and scale-ups. These companies tend to have complex communities that are constantly
changing size and shape. When we say community, we don't just mean a handful of the most
commmited users, but _everyone_ who is in orbit of the company. The Orbit Model uses the
broadest definition of community and then segments the community along a few different axes.
This helps product companies get a handle on what's happening across their whole
universe—users, customers, partners and everyone else—and plan and strategize holistically.

You don't need an existing community to use the Orbit Model.
If you have users, you can already apply some of the ideas in the model to help you
create stronger relationships with users, open up channels for high quality product feedback
and start developing an army of advocates who can help the product grow.

For modern product companies, building a healthy community is essential for getting
and sustaining widespread product adoption. Users expect to find a community and to
be able to find information and build relationships with other users. This builds
the trust that users and buyers need to navigate the adoption process from their side.
