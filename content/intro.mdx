The Orbit Model is a framework for building a high-gravity community. A high-gravity
community has a strong pull that holds members in orbit around the community's mission
and values.

The Orbit Model was created in 2014 by developer advocates and community builders. The creators
of the model had observed that community teams were being asked to
use the sales and marketing funnel to create their strategy and prove the ROI of their actions.
This felt wrong. It encouraged community builders to become more transactional at the cost of the
quality and loyalty in their community. It made reaching alignment between community builders and
company leaders more difficult.

The Orbit Model was conceived as an alternative to the
funnel that delivers positive outcomes for both the community and the company behind it.
With the funnel, the objective is to get the highest number of people to reach a single goal. With
the Orbit Model, the objective is to create a balanced community of members at different
engagement levels. The funnel is effective at driving conversion while the Orbit Model is
effective at driving adoption.

### Today's product communities

Today, the Orbit Model is popular amongst developer-first and SaaS product companies, both
startups and scale-ups. These companies tend to have complex communities that are constantly
changing size and shape. When we say community, we don't just mean a handful of the most
commmited users, but _everyone_ who is in orbit of the company. Everyone is a member.
The Orbit Model uses this
broad definition of community and then provides tools to segment and group complex communities into
manageable, intuitive buckets.
This helps companies get a handle on what's happening across their whole
universeâ€”users, customers, community members, partners and everyone else.

Now, let's dive in and introduce the main concepts of the model.
