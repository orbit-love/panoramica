<div className="text-xl font-bold">The Mission</div>

The mission is the community's **center of gravity**.
Members are attracted to the community by its purpose, identity, and
sense of shared values.
It is the job of the community leaders
to establish, communicate, and renew the mission as needed.

Encircling the mission are
**orbit levels**. These levels group members according to their relationship to the mission.
