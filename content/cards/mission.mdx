## Mission

A community's mission is a shared sense of purpose, values, identity and goals.
It is the center of gravity. A clear, strong mission is essential for attracting
new members and compelling existing members to contribute more and take on roles
of increasing leadership and responsibility.

Visually, community leaders orbit right by the mission. It is their job to set and
communicate the mission to members.
