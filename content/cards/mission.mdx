## Mission

A community's mission is a shared sense of purpose, values, identity and goals.
It is the center of gravity. A clear, strong mission is essential for attracting
new members and compelling existing members to contribute more and take on roles
of increasing leadership and responsibility. It is the job of the community leaders
to establish and communicate the mission.
