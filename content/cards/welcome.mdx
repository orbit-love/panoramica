## Welcome!

The Orbit Model is a framework for building strong, scalable communities.
It produces recommendations for increasing the **gravity** of the community,
the force that attracts and retains members.

Each member has an **orbit level** based on their pattern of activity.
The member's **love** determines their brightness and their **reach** determines
their size. Together, these attributes reveal a member's unique needs and opportunities.
