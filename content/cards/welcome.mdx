## Welcome!

The Orbit Model is a framework for building strong, scalable communities.
It's easy to learn and anyone can use it.

How does it work? The more that a member contributes to the community's
mission, the closer they orbit the center of the solar system.
Each member has 3 properties—**love**, **reach**, and **orbit level**.
These determine their needs and opportunities. Increasing member love
and reach increases the **gravity**, or attractive force, of the community.
