## Welcome!

The Orbit Model is a framework for building strong, scalable communities.

The model takes into account both the _activities_ members do and the _relationships_ that emerge
from them. It produces recommendations for increasing the **gravity** of the community,
the force that attracts and retains members.

Each member is given an **orbit level**
based on their general pattern of activity, determining where they orbit.
The member's **love** determines their brightness and their **reach** determines
their size. Together, these attributes surface a member's needs and opportunities.
