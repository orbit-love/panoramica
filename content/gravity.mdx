## Gravity = Love x Reach

**Gravity** is everything that pulls your members toward the center of the community
and prevents them from drifting away. In the Orbit Model, gravity is a
function of the love and reach of members.

A member's **love** represents how much they care about the mission
and how active they are in carrying it out. Are they leading the
charge or just curiously exploring?
A member's **reach** represents their degree of connectedness and influence,
accrued as they take action and increase visibility to others.

Both a member's love and reach are needed to understand their pull on other
members, and therefore their contribution to the community's gravity. A member
with high love and high reach creates a lot of gravity: their excitement pulls in
many other members as it propagates across their network.
On the other hand, a member with low love (or even dislike) will push members away
in accordance with their reach.

Community builders can increase the gravity of their community, and reach other goals,
by taking actions that increase the love and reach of their members, actions that either deepen
the member's commitment to the mission or expand their network of relationships and influence.

These actions should always **create value** for the member in the process, otherwise they will
eventually stop being receptive and their love and reach will decrease.

## Center of gravity

Before members can have love or accue reach through interaction, there has
to be an mission in place. The mission can be as formal as a documented list of goals
and values, or it can be as informal as the title of a chat room where people are
discussing a game.

In the Orbit Model, the mission is the community's **center of gravity**.
The mission is what attracts new members, keeps them coming back, and inspires
some to increase their love and reach over time.

As a community builder, the clearer you can be about your mission, the easier it
will be for members to align themselves around it and act. This will increase their love
and their reach as a byproduct.
If the mission is not clear, the compounding love & reach cycle cannot start and gravity
will not develop.

The clarity of the mission can be tested by defining the community's Orbit Levels
and doing the work to classify members based on their pattern of action-taking.
