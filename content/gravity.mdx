## Gravity = Love x Reach

**Gravity** is everything that pulls your members toward the center of the community
and keeps them in orbit. In the Orbit Model, gravity is a
function of the love and reach of members.

**Love** represents the member's level of involvement and responsibility.
Are they leading the charge or just curiously exploring?

**Reach** represents a member's degree of connectedness and influence within the community.
How essential is the member to the community's flow of information?

**Cultivating both love and reach is necessary to build a community.**
A member with high love and high reach creates a lot of gravity:
their excitement and contribution to the community pulls others in
and catalyzes action. On the other hand,
a member with low love (or even dislike) will push members away in accordance with their
reach â€” in other words, the greater their reach, the more people they potentially push away.

At the community level, love and reach are like the yin and yang - neither is complete without the other.
Without love, reach stagnates at the networking level and quickly gets old.
Without leveraging the collaborative powers of high reach, love remains an isolated phenomenon,
and can quickly grow weak.

**To increase gravity, a community must design loops where purposeful action
leads to deeper relationships, which lead to more
energy and excitement, and more activity.** "Purposeful" here means activity that's
**consistent** with the community's mission and enhances the wellbeing and connectedness of members.

These actions should always **create value** for the member in the process, otherwise they will
eventually stop being receptive and their love and reach will decrease.

Gravity, love, and reach provide a community builder with
a set of heuristics for describing their community and a model for
determining the right times and ways to invest in each member.

## Center of Gravity

In the Orbit Model, the mission is the community's **center of gravity**.
The mission is what attracts new members and facilitates the development of
love and reach. The mission is what members gravitate around. The deeper the
tie to the mission, the closer the member will orbit.

The clearer that a community is about it's mission, the easier it
will be for members to align themselves around it and develop love and reach.
A community's mission can be as light as "enjoying our shared interest in old movies"
or as ambitious as "giving everyone on planet earth access to clean drinking water".
