## Gravity = Love x Reach

**Gravity** is everything that pulls your members toward the center of the community
and prevents them from drifting away. In the Orbit Model, gravity is a
function of the love and reach of members.

**Love** is how much a member cares about the mission
and how active they are in carrying it out. Are they leading the
charge or just curiously exploring?

**Reach** represents a member's degree of connectedness and influence,
accrued as they build relationships and take actions that increase their visibility.

**Cultivating both love and reach is necessary to build a community.**
A member with high love and high reach creates a lot of gravity: their excitement
pulls in many other members as it amplifies across their network. On the other hand,
a member with low love (or even dislike) will push members away in accordance with their
reach — in other words, the greater their reach, the more people they potentially push away.

Knowledge of a member's gravity, both currently and historically, is fundamental
to approaching and interacting with them in ways they'll recognize and appreciate.
For example, a high-gravity member may be turned off receiving only
an impersonal mass invitation to a conference, whereas a new member would find
it appropriate.

It’s important to understand love and reach across the community as well.
Without reach, love is expressed individually but not collectively, and
collaboration and alignment will be weak.
Without love, reach is just empty networking and it quickly gets old.

**To increase gravity, a community must design loops where purposeful action
leads to deeper relationships, which lead to more
energy and excitement, and more activity.** "Purposeful" here means activity that's
**consistent** with the community's mission.

In this way, community builders can increase the gravity of their community, and reach other goals,
by taking actions that increase the love and reach of their members, actions that either deepen
the member's commitment to the mission or expand their network of relationships and influence.

These actions should always **create value** for the member in the process, otherwise they will
eventually stop being receptive and their love and reach will decrease.

Love and reach, taken together, provide a builder with
a set of heuristics for describing their community, as well as a
set of next actions that vary based on the shape of the community.
This is more applicable than a model like the sales funnel, which is purely descriptive.

## Center of gravity

Before members can have love or accrue reach through interaction, there has
to be a mission in place. The mission can be as formal as a documented list of goals
and values, or it can be as informal as the title of a chat room where people are
discussing a game.

In the Orbit Model, the mission is the community's **center of gravity**.
The mission is what attracts new members, keeps them coming back, and inspires
some to increase their love and reach over time.

As a community builder, the clearer you can be about your mission, the easier it
will be for members to align themselves around it and act. This will increase their love
and their reach as a byproduct.
