## Gravity

Gravity is everything that pulls your members toward the center of the community
and prevents them from drifting away. Members have gravity, relationships have gravity,
events have gravity, content has gravity, a product has gravity, and so on.
A community builder's job is to
create programs and facilitate relationships that make the community
more and more attractive over time, increasing the gravity.

### Center of gravity

The center of gravity of your community is **the mission**.
This is what gets members interested, keeps them coming back, and inspires some to increase their
responsibility and leadership over time.
