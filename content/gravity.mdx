## Gravity

Gravity is everything that pulls your members toward the center of the community
and prevents them from drifting away. Members have gravity, relationships have gravity,
events have gravity, content has gravity, a product has gravity, and so on.
A community builder's job is to
create programs and facilitate relationships that make the community
more and more attractive over time, increasing the gravity.

### Center of gravity

The center of gravity of your community is the mission and values.
These are what get members interested, keep them coming back, and inspire some to increase their
involvement over time. Much has been written about how to craft and communicate
a community's mission and values. We won't go into it much here, just to say it's
important and that it's impossible for a community to be high-gravity if members don't
understand what the community wants to accomplish and how it intends to act.
