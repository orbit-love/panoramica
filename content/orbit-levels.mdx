## Orbit Levels

Members orbit around your community's center of gravity. They orbit at different distances
according to their relationship to the community's mission. Members with responsibility who
lead the community toward its goals have a low (close) orbit. Members with interest
but no investment in the community have higher (far) orbits.

Orbit levels group members based on where they orbit.
Levels are used to build targeted community programs that meet members where they are,
and create pathways for members to increase their responsibility.
They are also used to understand the balance of the community and make adjustments, for
example to help a community pull in more participants to become contributors in response
to a gap.

Here are the standard levels. Each level has a name and a number.
These levels were chosen by observing key patterns of activity across many communities.
Members are placed into the innermost level that they are eligible for (e.g. members
who contribute and advocate are placed into advocates).

#### Level 0 - Leaders

The Leaders level contains members who are directly responsible for the community and the main
forces in organizing it. In product communities, these are employees of the company building
the product. In diagrams, members in this level are generally placed inside or right next
to the mission vs. orbiting at a certain distance.

#### Level 1 - Advocates

Advocates help the community mobilize and grow, building social proof and spreading the word.
They create content and give talks, leveraging the reach that they have.
In product communities, this level includes product **ambassadors** and **champions**.

#### Level 2 - Contributors

Contributors put some of their time toward helping the community or product
reach its goals, not only for their own immediate benefit.
In product communities, this level includes contributors of code, templates, documentation,
translation, and users who give product feedback and participate in beta groups.

#### Level 3 - Participants

Participants regularly engage in the community and build
connections with other members. In product communities, this level includes
the users of the product.

#### Level 4 - Explorers

Explorers are newcomers and passive observers who are primarily interested in
getting information and learning.
