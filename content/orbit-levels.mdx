## Orbit Levels

Members orbit at different distances around your community's center of gravity.
These distances correspond to the impact that the member has on the community,
through **their work** and **their relationships**.

Each level has a name and a number. The Orbit Model outlines 4 levels that work
for most communities. Members are grouped into levels based on the kinds of activities they do.
As their commitment and impact increase, they move closer to the center of gravity.

This segmentation will help you understand how bought-in each member is
and design programs to help them reach the next level. The size of each level
and the ratio between levels helps you understand the balance of the community
and find bottlenecks.

### Level 1 - Advocates

Advocates help the community mobilize and grow, building social proof and actively spreading the word.
They create content and give talks, leveraging the reach that they have.
In product communities, this level includes product ambassadors and champions.

Advocates have high love and reach relative to all members of the community. It is important to monitor changes to
an advocate's love and to keep finding ways to increase their reach. One consequence of advocates having
high reach is that their talents become widely visible and may attract other people or
communities to compete for their time. By continuing to increase their reach in the context of your
community, you will secure and expand the advocate relationship.

### Level 2 - Contributors

Contributors invest time directly toward helping the community or product
reach its goals, and not only for their own personal benefit.
In product communities, this level includes contributors of code, templates, documentation,
translation, and users who give product feedback and participate in beta groups.

<Orbit2 classes="text-[72px] text-indigo-500" />

Contributors tend to have lower reach than advocates. Helping a contributor
become an advocate by increasing their reach is often a win-win situation.

### Level 3 - Participants

Participants regularly engage in the community and build
connections with other members. In product communities, this level includes
the users of the product.

<Orbit3 classes="text-[72px] text-indigo-500" />

Participants tend to have small amounts of love and reach. In some cases,
they have more love than reach, and a good strategy is to introduce them to some
contributors and advocates and see if value can be exchanged. In other cases,
the participant has a lot of reach but not much love yet (e.g. they are an influencer
and most of their reach is outside the community). In that situation, taking time
to meet 1:1 with the participant and talk through the mission of the community
(or details of the product) can make them more willing to start using their reach
to amplify the community's message.

### Level 4 - Explorers

Explorers are newcomers and passive observers who are primarily interested in
getting information and learning. They won't have much love yet or reach within
the community.

<Orbit4 classes="text-[72px] text-indigo-500" />

If the explorer has a lot of reach outside the community, it may be worth getting
in touch with them earlier than other explorers. You want them to form the correct
impression of the community, and if it's a fit, to deepen their love and grow their
reach inside the community by starting to participate.

## Assigning orbit levels

Orbit levels correspond to the kinds of activities done by members in each
level — as a member’s commitment and impact increase, they move from outer to inner levels.

To classify members into orbit levels, we can look at their **patterns of activity**.
What kind of activities are they doing and how often? Each orbit level has a set of
patterns that determine what members belong to that level. Patterns associated to inner
orbit levels imply higher amounts of love and reach.

Note that as members move up in orbit level, their love and reach will naturally be increasing.
The patterns exist as a concrete way to verify their love and reach, which are
otherwise hard to quantify.

Using a product / open source community as an example, here is a list of orbit levels and patterns
that would place members into them:

- **Advocates**. Publishes 2 blog posts or videos per quarter, helps organize 2 or more events per year, mentors 1 or more contributors
- **Contributors**. Contributes 1 pull request per month, reviews multiple PRs and issues per month, attends quarterly product summit.
- **Participants**. Active product user (WAU/MAU), attended at least 1 online or physical event in the last year, Discord member with 1 post in the last 90 days
- **Explorers**. Newsletter subscribers, twitter followers, inactive users, one-time event attendees.

In addition to deciding orbit levels, you will use the patterns for each level in two ways.
First, to compare the activity of members at the same level.
Second, to set expectations with members (and other community leaders) about what’s required at each level.
Fill in the blank for each sentence below with a clear definition. This will ensure you can communicate about
your orbit levels in a clear and consistent fashion.

### Why patterns?

Mapping specific patterns to orbit levels helps the model reflect reality for your community.
As any community builder would attest, frequency of activity alone isn’t the mark of a true advocate, and
nor is doing a high-commitment activity only once.

Generally, the completion of certain milestones in addition to regular participation is
the key to progressing from the outer to the inner circles of the community.
No matter how many likes and thumbs-ups a member gives to your content,
they will not become a Participant or a Contributor. To make the leap, they would need
to start attending events, creating content, contributing code, or equivalent that indicates
their impact is increasing.
