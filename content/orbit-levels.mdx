## Orbit Levels

Members orbit at different distances around your community's center of gravity.
These distances correspond to the role that they play in helping the community
advance toward its mission, ranging from completely passive to fully active.

Each level has a name and a number. The Orbit Model outlines 4 levels that work
for most communities. We also encourage users to adapt the levels to their specific needs.

### Level 1 - Advocates

Advocates help the community mobilize and grow, building social proof and actively spreading the word.
They create content and give talks, leveraging the reach that they have.
In product communities, this level includes product ambassadors and champions.

Advocates have high love and reach. It is important to monitor changes to advocate
love and to keep finding ways to increase their reach. One consequence of advocates having
high reach is that their talents become widely visible and may attract other people or
communities to compete for their time. By continuing to increase their reach, in the
direction of deepening love for the community, you will secure the advocate relationship.

### Level 2 - Contributors

Contributors invest time directly toward helping the community or product
reach its goals, and not only for their own personal benefit.
In product communities, this level includes contributors of code, templates, documentation,
translation, and users who give product feedback and participate in beta groups.

Contributors tend to have lower reach than advocates. Helping a contributor
become an advocate by increasing their reach is often a win-win situation.

### Level 3 - Participants

Participants regularly engage in the community and build
connections with other members. In product communities, this level includes
the users of the product.

Participants tend to have small amounts of love and reach. In some cases,
they have more love than reach, and a good strategy is to introduce them to some
contributors and advocates and see if value can be exchanged. In other cases,
the participant has a lot of reach but not much love yet (e.g. they are an influencer
and most of their reach is outside the community). In that situation, taking time
to meet 1:1 with the participant and talk through the mission of the community
(or details of the product) can make them more willing to start using their reach
to amplify the community's message.

### Level 4 - Explorers

Explorers are newcomers and passive observers who are primarily interested in
getting information and learning. They won't have much love yet or reach within
the community.

If the explorer has a lot of reach outside the community, it may be worth getting
in touch with them earlier than other explorers. You want them to form the correct
impression of the community, and if it's a fit, to deepen their love and grow their
reach inside the community by starting to participate.

## Assigning orbit levels

Orbit levels are assigned based on **patterns of activity**. A member is placed into
the closest (innermost) orbit level for which they have a qualifying pattern of activity.
Orbit levels can have one or more patterns that assign members to them.

Using a product community as an example, here is a list of orbit levels and some patterns
that would place members into them:

- **Advocates**. Writing blog posts, sending tweets, giving talks, traveling to events, mentoring contributors.
- **Contributors**. Contributing code or documentation, sharing new ideas and influencing the roadmap, helping organize events, answering questions from partipants and explorers.
- **Participants**. Using the product, reporting bugs, requesting support, asking questions, attending events, reading what's been written by advocates and contributors.
- **Explorers**. Subscribing to the newsletter, reading the documentation, following on social media, joining a webinar.

Sitting down and writing out the list of orbit levels and patterns is one of the first
steps you'll take when starting to use the Orbit Model. While there'll never be a single
right answer, it's important to be explicit about what patterns of activity truly reflect
a member's level of impact toward the community's mission. This ensures you don't grow a member's
love and reach in the wrong direction, one that has little, no, or a negative impact on gravity.

You will use these patterns not
only to evaluate the activity of members but also to set expectations, both with members and
inside of your organization. _To us, an Advocate is someone who **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**_. Defining your patterns will
make sure you can fill-in-the-blank to that sentence for each level and communicate and measure
it clearly.

- _To us, an Advocate is someone who **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**_
- _To us, a Contributor is someone who **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**_
- _To us, a Participant is someone who **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**_
- _To us, an Explorer is someone who **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**_

To make patterns that are **testable** and can reliably used to assign orbit levels, you'll usually need to make
some decisions around the **timeframe** and **quantity** of activities. You'll also need to
define whether sets of activities are **complementary** or **substitutable** - whether the member
needs to fulfill multiple patterns or any pattern to be included in an orbit level.

Here's an example of patterns for the Advocate level, building on the product community example from before:

```
An Advocate is someone who...

- Publishes 2 or more blog posts per month, every month AND
- Organizes 2 or more events in their local region per year OR
  - Attends 4 or more global events per year AND
- Responds to questions weekly in our community forum AND
- Has completed our in-person community training program
```

Choose numbers and timeframes that represent a member at the _middle_ of their orbit level. That is to say,
they are not the lowest or the highest member in the level according to their activities, love, and reach.
They are at the median, defining the **baseline**. If they keep doing the same thing, you'll be happy, and you'd
also expect some members to be doing less or more.

Choosing the median instead of the minimum level of activity to define the pattern makes it more useful for
testing. Instead of a pass/fail test, you can see who is below/at/above. This will help you better understand
the role of members at the same level, and operationally it can also make it easier to classify members in
a more flexible way. Rather than seeing if a minimum is met, a smarter algorithm can test if the member's
activity is sufficiently like one of the possible patterns.

## Balancing orbit levels

One practical use of orbit levels is determining how **balanced** the community is.
By balanced, we mean that there are enough people in the right levels to propel
the community's mission forward in an effective way, and to create as much
gravity as possible in the process.

When a community is out of balance, it is leaving opportunity on the table. For
example, if a community has 10 Advocates but only 5 Contributors, there is a lost
opportunity for Advocates to support and mentor more Contributors, to help maintain
a strong pipeline for future Advocates as the community evolves.

As another example, a community may have just a few Advocates and Contributors
supporting hundreds or thousands of Participants and Explorers. In some cases
this may be okay, but it's likely that the community could work faster toward
its mission, and avoid overstressing its inner circles, by working to help some
Participants become Contributors and Advocates.

When starting with the Orbit Model, we recommend that you first sit down and
describe your orbit levels and the patterns associated with them. As a next step,
we recommend writing out what you believe is an ideal balance between the orbit
levels you've defined. There's no right or wrong answer, but here are some of
the things to optimize for:

- **Mentoring**. Between two levels, what balance will lead to an optimal amount
  of supporting and mentoring? How many Contributors can an Advocate support and mentor?
  Think about this between each pair of levels. A community is stronger and more scalable
  if support and mentoring are happening between members one level apart vs. all mentorship
  coming from the center.
- **Growth**. If growth is a goal of your community, think about the ratios that will
  make growth sustainable. If your goal is to grow the overall community by 200%, think
  about how many Advocates and Contributors it will take to support an influx of Participants and Explorers.
- **Work**. Some communities have a clear idea of how much work, and what kind of work, needs
  to be completed for the community to succeed at its mission. If that's the case for you, think about
  how many members are needed at each level and what their specific contributions will be. An open
  source project may know that it needs a handful of core team members (Advocates) and a few dozen
  Contributors (reviewing and merging PRs) to support hundreds of Participants (opening issues and asking questions) and thousands of Explorers
  (reading docs and content).
