## Orbit Levels

Members orbit at different distances around your community's center of gravity.
These distances correspond to the impact that the member has on the community,
through their **actions** and **relationships**. Each member is assigned
an orbit level based on their pattern of activity and influence.

Community builders use orbit levels to:

- Calibrate member experiences based on give-and-take expectations for their level
- Set goals for level sizes, create plans and strategy, and track progress
- Map out the member journey as a function of moving between levels; find early indicators of future leaders and of stagnation & churn
- Measure the balance of the community and find bottlenecks; balance is a function of the ratio of level sizes
- Measure the gravity of the community and how it changes over time; gravity is a function of the aggregate movement between levels over time
- Lots more!

The Orbit Model outlines 4 levels that work for most communities.
Each level describes a broad class of members gravitating at the same level.
Let's look at each level starting with those closest to the center of gravity.

### Level 1 - Advocates

Advocates help the community mobilize and grow, building social proof and actively spreading the word.
They create content and give talks, leveraging the reach that they have.
In product communities, this level includes product ambassadors and champions.

Advocates have high love and reach relative to all members of the community. It is important to monitor changes to
an advocate's love and to keep finding ways to increase their reach. One consequence of advocates having
high reach is that their talents become widely visible and may attract other people or
communities to compete for their time. By continuing to increase their reach in the context of your
community, you will secure and expand the advocate relationship.

### Level 2 - Contributors

Contributors invest time directly toward helping the community or product
reach its goals, and not only for their own personal benefit.
In product communities, this level includes contributors of code, templates, documentation,
translation, and users who give product feedback and participate in beta groups.

Contributors tend to have lower reach than advocates. Helping a contributor
become an advocate by increasing their reach is often a win-win situation.

### Level 3 - Participants

Participants regularly engage in the community and build
connections with other members. In product communities, this level includes
the users of the product.

<div className="md:px-32">![Participants](/participants.png)</div>

Participants tend to have small amounts of love and reach. In some cases,
they have more love than reach, and a good strategy is to introduce them to some
contributors and advocates and see if value can be exchanged. In other cases,
the participant has a lot of reach but not much love yet (e.g. they are an influencer
and most of their reach is outside the community). In that situation, taking time
to meet 1:1 with the participant and talk through the mission of the community
(or details of the product) can make them more willing to start using their reach
to amplify the community's message.

### Level 4 - Explorers

Explorers are newcomers and passive observers who are primarily interested in
getting information and learning. They won't have much love yet or reach within
the community.

If the explorer has a lot of reach outside the community, it may be worth getting
in touch with them earlier than other explorers. You want them to form the correct
impression of the community, and if it's a fit, to deepen their love and grow their
reach inside the community by starting to participate.

## Assigning Orbit Levels

To classify members into orbit levels, we can look at their **patterns of activity**.
What kind of activities are they doing, how often, and who with?
What signs of growing love and reach can we infer from the activity?

**Members act through the love and reach they have in the moment**. As love and reach change,
so do the actions the member takes, and so do the patterns we can observe about them.
Among other things, this allows us to place them into the right orbit level.

Here's an example of patterns that could be defined for a product or open source community:

- **Advocates**. Publishes 2 blog posts or videos per quarter, helps organize 2 or more events per year, mentors 1 or more contributors
- **Contributors**. Contributes 1 pull request per month, reviews multiple PRs and issues per month, attends quarterly product summit.
- **Participants**. Active product user (WAU/MAU), attended at least 1 online or physical event in the last year, Discord member with 1 post in the last 90 days
- **Explorers**. Newsletter subscribers, twitter followers, inactive users, one-time event attendees.

Use these prompts to help determine the patterns in your community.

- _To us, an Advocate is someone who **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**_
- _To us, a Contributor is someone who **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**_
- _To us, a Participant is someone who **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**_
- _To us, an Explorer is someone who **\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**_

To fill in the blanks, think about:

- The type of activities (attending events, creating content)
- How frequently the activities happen (every day/week/month)
- The role the member is playing (active vs. passive)
- Who the activities are done with (few vs. many, same or different orbit levels)

Your answers may fall in-between
what members are doing today and what you'd like them to be doing.
If so, use that information to update your community strategy.
