## Orbit Levels

Members orbit around your community's center of gravity. They orbit at different distances
according to their relationship to the community's mission and their patterns
of activity.
Members are grouped into orbit level based on where they orbit.
Each level has a name and a number.
Members are placed into the innermost level that they are eligible for (e.g. members
who both contribute and advocate are placed into advocates).

#### Level 1 - Advocates

Advocates help the community mobilize and grow, building social proof and spreading the word.
They create content and give talks, leveraging the reach that they have.
In product communities, this level includes product **ambassadors** and **champions**.

#### Level 2 - Contributors

Contributors put some of their time toward helping the community or product
reach its goals, not only for their own immediate benefit.
In product communities, this level includes contributors of code, templates, documentation,
translation, and users who give product feedback and participate in beta groups.

#### Level 3 - Participants

Participants regularly engage in the community and build
connections with other members. In product communities, this level includes
the users of the product.

#### Level 4 - Explorers

Explorers are newcomers and passive observers who are primarily interested in
getting information and learning.
