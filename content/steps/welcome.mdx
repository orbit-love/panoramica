## This is a community.

In the Orbit Model, a community is a network of people with
a shared mission.
The mission and the network act as sources of gravity, pulling
members into orbit and holding them there.
Members orbit at different levels according to their role in
the community and the relationships they've built. A member's
level changes over time as their interest waxes and wanes.
