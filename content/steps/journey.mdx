## Member Journeys

As a community builder, Jeri's member journey is one you're sure
to be proud of. But it's by no means the only valid journey,
and a moment will likely come when it's time for Jeri to orbit
in a different way.

No journey is right or wrong. As a community
builder, your job is to know members well
enough to facilitate the right journey
based on their love, reach, and interests.
