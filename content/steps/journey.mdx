## Journeys are Unique

As a community builder, Jeri's member journey is one of the best you
could hope for. But it's by no means the only valid journey,
and a moment will likely come when it's time for Jeri to orbit
in a different way.

No journey is right or wrong. As a community
builder using the Orbit Model, your job is to know members well
enough to facilitate the right journey for them
based on signals you can gather about their love, reach, and interests.
