## Meet Jeri

Jeri is an Explorer. Jeri reads the community's
public blog and has just registered for an upcoming workshop,
a sign that Jeri's love is growing. Before the workshop,
the Orbit Model recommends introducing Jeri to a few experienced
members who'll be there, so they can get a head start building up reach.
