## The Journey of Jeri

Let's look at how members change levels over time
and what actions the Orbit Model recommends to facilitate

Jeri is a Level 4 _Explorer_. Jeri reads the community's
blog and has registered for an upcoming workshop.
Before the workshop,
the Orbit Model recommends introducing Jeri to a few experienced
members who'll be there.
