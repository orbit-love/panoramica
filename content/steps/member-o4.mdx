## Meet Jeri

Jeri is an Explorer. Jeri reads the community's
public blog and has just registered for an upcoming workshop,
a sign that Jeri's love is growing. Before the workshop,
the Orbit Model recommends introducing Jeri to a few experienced
members who'll be there. By increasing love and reach together,
we can accelerate the member's journey.
