## Jeri the Participant

Thanks to the introductions you made, Jeri had a great time at the workshop
and has signed up for a few more. She's also starting meeting regularly with
some of the members she met there. It's safe to say that Jeri is no longer just
Exploring but truly Participating. Nice work!
