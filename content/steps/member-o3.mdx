## Jeri, now a Participant!

Voilà! Thanks to the intros, Jeri had a great time at the workshop
and already signed up for the next one. Jeri's also planning to
meet regularly with some members she met. We can now say that
Jeri has reached the next level as a Participant. By facilitating
an increase in _reach_ as the same time as love, we increased the chance
of Jeri moving to the next level.
