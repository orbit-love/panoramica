## Jeri, now an Advocate!

At the conference Jeri gave a presentation, MC'd for one full day,
and met all of the members considered to be at the Advocate level.
The delta between Jeri's activities and those of the Advocates has shrunk
over time and is now negligible.

As a community builder, you decide that Jeri is ready to be considered
an Advocate. Nice work! You speak to Jeri about joining your Ambassador
program, open only to members at the Advocate level.
