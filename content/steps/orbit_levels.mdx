## Orbit Levels

Members orbit the community at different _orbit levels_.
Members in each orbit level are similar in the role they play
in the community (love) and their level of influence (reach).

Within an orbit level, members have different amounts of love, reach,
and gravity relative to each other. In the image, the members with the
highest gravity are placed at 12 o'clock, with gravity descending in
the clockwise direction.
