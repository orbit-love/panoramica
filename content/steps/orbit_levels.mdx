## Orbit Levels

Members orbit at different distances according to their
relationship to the mission. These distances are grouped
into _orbit levels_. Members who actively lead and contribute
are located in orbit levels close to the center of gravity.
Passively involved members orbit in the outer levels.
A member's pattern of activity determines what orbit level
they are placed in.
