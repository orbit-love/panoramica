## Gravity = Love x Reach

Gravity attracts members and keeps them in orbit.
The major sources of gravity are
the community's mission and the _love_ and _reach_ of existing members.

Members increase their love by acting regularly and taking on more responsibility.
Members increase their reach by building relationships and expanding their influence.
