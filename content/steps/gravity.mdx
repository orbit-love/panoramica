## Gravity = Love Ã— Reach

The network's gravity is a function of the _love_ and _reach_ of each member.
Love is the member's degree of leadership, responsibility, and commitment.
Reach is the member's degreee of connectness, visibility, and influence.

In the image, planet brightness represents love and the number of rings
represents reach, relative to members at the same level.
