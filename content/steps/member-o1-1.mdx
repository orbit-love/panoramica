## The Path to Advocacy

Fast forward six months and Jeri has continued to lead workshops,
coordinate introductions, and has expressed interest in helping organize
the community's annual conference. Hooray!

Since both love and reach are strong, neither needs special attention. To
help Jeri develop further, the Orbit Model recommends comparing Jeri's
activities to those of members at the next level - Advocates. It turns out
that every Advocate plays a big role in the community's conference, so asking
Jeri to be involved is a smart next move.
