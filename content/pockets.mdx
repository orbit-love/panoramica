## Pockets

As a community starts to grow, smaller communities begin to form inside of it. In
the Orbit Model, we call these pockets of gravity, or just pockets for short.
Every pocket has at least one characteristic that all members have in common.
A pocket can be anything - a customer club, a champions program, a Chicago
meetup chapter, a cohort of the most active product users, or even the friends
and followers of a popular community member. A pocket can be "members who have done X"
or "members who have done X and Y". Members can be part of any number of pockets.

Some pockets contain members with
the same orbit level. Other pockets contain members at a mix of orbit levels.
Some pockets imply a minimum orbit level, which is to say that any member in the
pocket must have (or should be given) that orbit level.

Like members, pockets orbit the community solar system. They can be drawn as simple
planets, as clusters of planets, or as clouds that diffuse members
across different orbit levels. How fancy you want to get is up to you (and your designer).
Sometimes you may want to depict only members, sometimes only pockets, and sometimes
a combination of both.

Thankfully, to use the Orbit Model you don't need to know what every pocket
in your community is. But you may want to map out the type of pockets
that imply a minimum orbit level, because these will give you an easy, reliable way to map
members to orbit levels. This is covered in the next section.
