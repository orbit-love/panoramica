The Orbit Model is a framework for building high-gravity communities that
excel at attracting and retaining members.
The model was created in 2014 as a tool to help community and developer relations teams
multiply their impact and communicate business results.
Since then it has been used by thousands of organizations to be more intentional in
how they plan, organize, and scale their communities.

The Orbit Model is a complement to the sales and marketing funnel.
It is a different metaphor that works better
for the more intricate challenges of community building.
While the funnel has a single
goal and tries to _push_ everyone toward it, the Orbit Model recognizes multiple goals and
allows members to _pull_ themselves toward the level of involvement that's right for them.

What is a community? The Orbit Model defines a community as both:

- A group of people working voluntarily toward a shared mission
- The network of relationships that emerges as members collaborate

Or for short, **a network with a mission**.
By looking at the intersection between the community as both a mission and a network, the Orbit
Model unlocks powerful insights that make community leaders more effective.
