## Assigning members to orbit levels

There are a few different options and there is not a single right or wrong answer.
What you plan to do with the levels will influence how you assign members to them.

#### Option 1 - By hand

One option is simply manual. Look at each member and decide whether they have been exploring,
participating, contributing, or advocating. This is a good approach for small communities.
Even for large communities, this is a good approach for classifying members in the innermost
(much smaller) orbit levels.

#### Option 2 - Use pockets

In this approach, first, we define a set of pockets. We look specifically for pockets that
imply a minimum orbit level, so that any member in that pocket will be given that
orbit level. This is easiest to explain with an example.

For a product community, here is a common list of 2 pockets for each orbit
level:

- **Advocates**: Conference and Meetup Speakers; Champions Program Members
- **Contributors**: Beta User Group; Customer Advisory Board
- **Participants**: Product Users; Event Attendees
- **Explorers**: Twitter Followers; Newsletter Subscribers

Some nuance here is that being a Product User doesn't make a member an Participant.
It makes a member _eligible_ to be an Participant. Ultimately, the member is given the
innermost orbit level for any pocket they are within.

This approach requires the extra step of defining pockets, but it also has advantages.

- It doesn't require deciding the level for each member one-at-a-time, only what pockets they're a part of.
- When a member joins or leaves a pocket, its straightforward to adjust their orbit level; no other maintenance is necessary.
- No complicated math or formulas.
- Defining important pockets is a best practice, this approach won't incur extra overhead if that's being done already.

One thing to watch out for with this approach is that some members may not be a part of any pockets
defined. This can signal that the definition isn't complete enough. Check if there are some large
catch-all pockets that should be created. As a last resort, create some rules for members who
don't belong to any pocket.

#### Option 3 - Use a formula

A 3rd option is to use a formula that outputs a score for each member that reflects
their overall engagement, and/or indicates which orbit level their activities are
most characteristic of. This approach can be effective if the data available is sufficient.
It will require collecting and processing data over time.

#### What do we recommend?

In the past, the Orbit Model has prescribed an approach that is close to option 3, basing
the orbit level on a calculated value of _Love_ for each member. Our
recommendation has changed to option 2. The two reasons are a) that it is similar and more
intuitive, and b) that pockets add a depth of understanding to the community that is
useful in even more ways.
