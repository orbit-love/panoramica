### Discussion: The Orbit Model and the Funnel

What is the relationship between the orbit model and the marketing funnel?
This is a common question, and a good one. A company that sells a product
and has a community should use both of them together. But what are the key differences?

The funnel is a model for _capturing value_ for the company. The key measurements
are conversion through the different stages and ultimately the revenue from conversion.
**The Orbit Model is a model for creating value for the community**. We measure how much
value is being created in the community and who is doing it, in order to offer
the people the right rewards and opportunities.

Here's a common situation when a company adopts the orbit model.
The community and developer relation teams use orbit to foster
community engagement and growth, while marketing and sales teams
continue to use the funnel to drive purchases and revenue. Think of
it like an ice cream cone, with a big scoop perched on a waffle cone.
Inevitably, some of the ice cream melts and trickles down the cone.
The bigger the scoop, the more reaches the cone.

The Orbit Model and funnel meet when a community member reaches the
decision that they'd like to purchase or evaluate a product.
