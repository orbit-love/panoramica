## Love

When we speak of a member's **love**, we are referring to their level of
alignment and activity toward the community's mission. Love is synonymous
with:

- Leadership
- Responsibility
- Involvement
- Commitment

Love is a **journey**, and it can be a straight shot or a winding road.
Members typically start out with a passive, curious interest
in the community without any commitment or responsibility, with activity patterns
that locate them in the Explorers orbit level.
As some members transform passive curiosity into active
involvement, their love goes up and they're like to fit the pattern of
Participants, Contributors, and Advocates. Member love can also decrease over
time if their activity decreases or their patterns shift to those associated
with outer orbit levels.

Knowledge of a member's love, both currently and historically, is fundamental
to approaching and interacting with them in ways they'll recognize and appreciate.
For example, a high-love member may be turned off receiving only
an impersonal mass invitation to a conference, whereas a new member would find
it appropriate.

### Love in action

When using the Orbit Model day-to-day, you'll be looking at each member's
**love**, **reach**, and **orbit level** to see if the combination of these
variables means some action should be taken.

When it comes to love, what we look for is whether the member's love is
low or high relative to other members in their orbit level, and how that love has been
changing. We look to see how their activity compares to the baselines defined
by the patterns associated with the level. Are they doing more than expected,
less than expected, or right on the baseline?

How can we determine the love for a member? It depends on the data we have.
Qualities like commitment and responsibility are difficult to measure at scale.
You might have a handle on them for members you're closest to, but for everyone else,
you can use easier-to-measure metrics like engagement as a proxy. This isn't perfect,
but it works well when there are obvious differences in behavioral patterns.
For example, it is reasonable to conclude that one person who joined a Discord server
has lower love than someone who joined and then started asking and answering questions.

Visually on the Orbit Model canvas, a member's love is represented
by the **brightness** or the **color** of their celestial body. The brightest members in
an orbit level have the strongest patterns of activity. They are the most luminous,
the most intense, the most energetic. The dimmest
members in an orbit level have the weakest patterns of activity, or
no activity at all. Colors can provide another level of visual differentiation,
using blues for love that is below baseline, neutral at the baseline, and reds
above the baseline.

While it is possible to compare love across all members
in a community, it's most useful when comparing members in the same orbit level,
for the reason that the baseline for an Advocate has little in common with
that of an Explorer.
