## Love

When we speak of a member's **love**, we are referring to their level of
alignment and activity toward the community's mission. Love is synonymous
with:

- Leadership
- Responsibility
- Involvement
- Commitment

Love is a **journey**, and it can be a straight shot or a winding road.
Members typically start out with a passive, curious interest
in the community without any commitment or responsibility.

As some members transform passive curiosity into active
involvement, their love goes up and they're likely to start participating,
contributing, and advocating more. Member love can also decrease over
time if their activity decreases or their patterns shift to those associated
with outer orbit levels.
