## Love

When we speak of a member's **love**, we are referring to their level of
alignment and activity toward the community's mission. Love is synonymous
with:

- Leadership
- Responsibility
- Involvement
- Commitment

Love is a **journey**, and it can be a straight shot or a winding road.
Members typically start out with a passive, curious interest
in the community without any commitment or responsibility, with activity patterns
that locate them in the Explorers orbit level.

As some members transform passive curiosity into active
involvement, their love goes up and they're likely to fit the pattern of
Participants, Contributors, and Advocates. Member love can also decrease over
time if their activity decreases or their patterns shift to those associated
with outer orbit levels.

While it is possible to compare love across all members
in a community, it's most useful when comparing members in the same orbit level,
for the reason that the baseline for an Advocate has little in common with
that of an Explorer.
