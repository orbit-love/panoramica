## Stages

A member's journey in a community goes through **stages** that help them move from
one orbit level to another. At first, a member is new and
needs to informed. If they like the community, they will reach a stage of regular activity.
The best fitting members will reach stages of contributing work and promoting the community.

Stages exist between each orbit level. The name of the stage indicates what kind
of activities a community builder should be thinking about to help members move
along to the next stage of their journey.

### Stage: Inform

**New to Exploring**. A member is new to the community. Give them the information they will
need to navigate. If they look like a promising fit, reach out and make
personal introductions.

### Stage: Activate

**Exploring to Participating**.
A member has been exploring and shows signs of participating.
Start to invite them to events and show them the opportunities for
participating. In a product community, this is when
someone is ready to become a product user, for the first time or more
seriously than before.

### Stage: Delegate

**Participating to Contributing**.
A member has been participating and shows signs of contributing.
Start to delegate contribution opportunities to them.

### Stage: Promote

**Contributing to Advocating**.
A member has been contributing and shows signs of advocating. Start to
promote them around the community and increase their visibility. Give them
opportunities to create content, give talks, and generally expand the
reach within their community.

### Stage: Recruit

**Advocating to Leading**.
If a member is such a great fit for the mission of the community (or the
product behind it), there might be a path to them joining community leadership
or taking a role with the company.
