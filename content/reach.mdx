## Reach

**Reach** is a measure of a member's sphere of influence, their degree of
visibility, and their connectedness.
High-reach members maintain a wide network of
active relationships and help move information throughout the community.
Whereas love is based on _what_ a member does and _how often_, reach is
concerned with _who_ the member does activities with. Reach is synonymous with:

- Connectedness
- Influence
- Reputation
- Visibility
- Network

Reach keeps the community bonded as it goes through experiences and transformations.
The more active, healthy relationships in the community, the better able the
community is to align and stay motivated.

Reach accumulates naturally from people working toward shared interests, but that
doesn't mean community builders can just sit back and assume it will happen.
Especially in the online world, the development of reach can't be taken for granted
because it's very easy for people to work together without forming a true connection.
Community builders should think intentionally about how to develop the networks of
their members, and not only the activities they're expected to do.

The Orbit Model makes the distinction between a member's **internal reach** and
**external reach**. Internal reach is reach within the community. External reach is
reach in general, including in other communities. If a member has a high external
reach and a low internal reach, it implies they have a strong network of connections
and influence generally, but have only started to create connections and influence
within the community itself.

### Reach in action

In the Orbit Model, reach is represented visually by the size of the member's
body in orbit. The greater the reach, the more gravity the member has, and the more
they'll attract others to themselves and the activities they're doing.

Like love, reach is most usefully compared amongst members at the same orbit level.
Especially with internal reach, we wouldn't expect an Explorer or Participant to
have close to the network depth of an Advocate. We'd be more interested in how the
networks of Advocates compare.
