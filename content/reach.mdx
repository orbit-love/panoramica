## Reach

**Reach** is a measure of a member's sphere of influence, their degree of
visibility, and their connectedness.
High-reach members maintain a wide network of
active relationships and help move information throughout the community.
Whereas love is based on _what_ a member does and _how often_, reach is
concerned with _who_ the member does activities with. Reach is synonymous with:

- Connectedness
- Visibility
- Influence
- Network

Reach keeps the community bonded as it goes through experiences and transformations.
The more active, healthy relationships in the community, the better able the
community is to align and stay motivated.

Reach accumulates naturally from people working toward shared interests, but that
doesn't mean community builders can just sit back and assume it will happen.
Especially in the online world, the development of reach can't be taken for granted
because it's very easy for people to work together without forming a true connection.
Community builders should think intentionally about how to develop the networks of
their members, and not only the activities they're expected to do.

### Internal vs. External Reach

The Orbit Model makes the distinction between a member's **internal reach** and
**external reach**. Internal reach is reach within the community. External reach is
reach in general, including in other communities. If a member has a high external
reach and a low internal reach, it implies they have a strong network of connections
and influence generally, but have only started to create connections and influence
within the community itself.
