## Reach

**Reach** is a measure of a member's sphere of influence and their degree of
visibility and connectedness.
High-reach members maintain a wide network of
active relationships and help move information throughout the community.
Whereas love is based on _what_ a member does and _how often_, reach is
concerned with _who_ the member does activities with. Reach is synonymous with:

- Connectedness
- Influence
- Reputation
- Visibility
- Network

Reach keeps the community bonded as it goes through experiences and transformations.
The more active, healthy relationships in the community, the better able the
community is to align and stay motivated.

Reach accumulates naturally from people working toward shared interests, but that
doesn't mean community builders can just sit back and assume it will happen.
Especially in the online world, the development of reach can't be taken for granted
because it's very easy for people to work together without forming a true connection.
Community builders should think intentionally about how to develop the networks of
their members, and not only the activities they're expected to do.

The Orbit Model makes the distinction between a member's **internal reach** and
**external reach**. Internal reach is reach within the community. External reach is
reach in general, including in other communities. If a member has a high external
reach and a low internal reach, it implies they have a strong network of connections
and influence generally, but have only started to create connections and influence
within the community itself.

### Reach in action

In the Orbit Model, reach is represented visually by the size of the member's
body in orbit. The greater the reach, the more gravity the member has, and the more
they'll attract others to themselves and the activities they're doing.

One way to explore reach is to use graph visualizations, as in graph theory.
In these diagrams, each member is represented by a dot, and the lines between
dots represent relationships.
Graphs make it easy to see who each member is connected
to and what **pockets of gravity** exist in the community. A pocket of gravity is a
cluster of members who interact regularly. As communities scale, they tend to end up
with many different pockets. One of the challenges for community leaders is to
allow pockets to flourish while still staying connected to the whole. It becomes essential
to cultivate members who act as **bridges** between pockets and the whole, so that
the community's love keeps flowing in a single direction.

Like love, reach is most usefully compared amongst members at the same orbit level.
Especially with internal reach, we wouldn't expect an Explorer or Participant to
have close to the network depth of an Advocate. We'd be more interested in how the
networks of Advocates compare.
