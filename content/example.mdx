## Example: Be a Coach with a Clipboard

You've made it through all of the major concepts in the Orbit Model. Congrats!
Now let's look at some examples and how to use the model in practice.
We'll walk through how to be like a coach for your community, keenly identifying
the most important opportunities and sketching out a series of winning plays.

An easy place to start is by asking these two questions for members at each orbit level,
relative to their peers:

1. Who has high love but low reach?
1. Who has high reach but low love?

Look for members who currently have **a lot** of one attribute but **not much** of the other.
The bigger the gap, the more likely that there's some low-hanging fruit to
increasing the member's gravity. Gravity is the product of love and reach and it's easier
to increase a value that is low vs. one that is already high.

#### Tomi the Contributor

Let's look at an example with community member **Tomi**. Tomi is a Contributor to an open
source community and has high love and low reach relative to their peers. Tomi's patterns of
activity include frequent code contributions, documentation updates, and blog posts. Tomi's
doing excellent work, however only a few people in the community are aware as Tomi is
still relatively new and has only briefly chatted with a few other members.
In this scenario, working to increase Tomi's already high **love** will take more effort
and have less of an impact on gravity than increasing their reach. Since the reach is low,
activities as simple as a group call or sharing a meal could double or triple the sense of
connection that Tomi has to the community, and pave the way to more members becoming familiar
with their work.

#### The Orbital Plot

The solar system visualization at the one top of this page is a useful way to
visualize the whole community.
But when it comes to spotting opportunities for specific members and groups,
itâ€™s helpful to zoom in and use a different type of diagram.

The _orbital plot_ shows:

- A curved line for each orbit level
- Love on the horizontal axis
- Reach on the vertical axis

The plot is designed to make it obvious if a member has a big difference in love
and reach or if they are relatively balanced. If more balanced, they will appear closer
to an imaginary center line running through the midpoint of each curved line.
If they have a lot more reach, they'll appear high and to the left. If they have a lot more
love, they'll appear lower and to the right.

The plot can also be extended to add layers of information.
Hereâ€™s an example plot where:

- **Color** corresponds to the orbit level
- **Size** corresponds to the memberâ€™s reach
- **Brightness** corresponds to the recency of the member's activity

With the plot in hand, it's time to start sketching out some plays.

In **Orbit 4**, you have a member with high reach and low love, but who has been active recently. Thereâ€™s also a member with low reach and high love, but whom we havenâ€™t seen in a while.

In **Orbit 3**, you have a member with very high love and high reach whoâ€™s more active than average, as well as a member with average love and reach for their level.

In **Orbit 2**, you have a member with high love, low reach, and high activity.

And in **Orbit 1**, you have a member with low reach (relative to their level) and high reach, but not a lot of recent activity.
