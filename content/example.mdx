## Example: taking action

_ðŸš§ under construction_

Together, **orbit level**, **love**, and **reach** tell you a lot about a person's
relationship to your community, its mission, and other members. Now, let's look at an
example of how to use this information in practice.

On this image we can see 5 members, a-e, orbiting the community at different levels
and with varying levels of love and reach.

Let's look at each member one-by-one and see what the Orbit Model recommends that we do.

#### Member a

Looks like a new person to your orbit. They have high reach but low love for their level.

- Goal: increase their love
- Plays: Ideas for things to try

#### Member b

This person is also new, but they have higher love than others in orbit 4.

- Goal: increase their reach
- Plays: Ideas for things to try

#### Member c

This person has made it to O3 based on their patterns of activity, but their reach is low compared to others at this level.

- Goal: increase their reach
- Plays: Ideas for things to try

#### Member d

This person in O2 has made significant contribution to the community, and theyâ€™re right in the middle of their level in terms of love and reach.

- Goal: get them to O1
- Plays: Ideas for things to try

#### Member e

This member of O1 is one of your strongest contributors.

- Goal: further amplify their voice and contributions
