## Example: taking action

_ðŸš§ under construction_

Together, **orbit level**, **love**, and **reach** tell you a lot about a person's
relationship to your community, its mission, and other members.

The orbital canvas, like the one at the top of this page, is a nice way to visualize a community overall.
But when it comes to assessing specific people and groups, and comparing them to other people
and groups, itâ€™s helpful to zoom in and use a different type of diagram.

This visualization shows:

- The four Orbit Levels
- Love on the horizontal axis
- Reach on the vertical axis
- Color corresponds to the Orbit Level for additional visual cues
- Size corresponds to the memberâ€™s reach
- The brightness of each dot represents the member's activity recency â€” lots of activity lately will glow brighter than activity from a long time ago

Hereâ€™s an example orbit plot:

<div className="">![](/om-wedge-example.jpg)</div>

In **Orbit 4**, you have a member with high reach and low love, but who has been active recently. Thereâ€™s also a member with low reach and high love, but whom we havenâ€™t seen in a while.

In **Orbit 3**, you have a member with very high love and high reach whoâ€™s more active than average, as well as a member with average love and reach for their level.

In **Orbit 2**, you have a member with high love, low reach, and high activity.

And in **Orbit 1**, you have a member with low reach (relative to their level) and high reach, but not a lot of recent activity.
