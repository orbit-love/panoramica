# Balancing Orbit Levels

One practical use of orbit levels is determining how **balanced** the community is.
By balanced, we mean that there are enough people in the right levels to propel
the community's mission forward in an effective way, and to create as much
gravity as possible in the process.

When a community is out of balance, it is leaving opportunity on the table. For
example, if a community has 10 Advocates but only 5 Contributors, there is a lost
opportunity for Advocates to support and mentor more Contributors, to help maintain
a strong pipeline for future Advocates as the community evolves.

As another example, a community may have just a few Advocates and Contributors
supporting hundreds or thousands of Participants and Explorers. In some cases
this may be okay, but it's likely that the community could work faster toward
its mission, and avoid overstressing its inner circles, by working to help some
Participants become Contributors and Advocates.

When starting with the Orbit Model, we recommend that you first sit down and
describe your orbit levels and the patterns associated with them. As a next step,
we recommend writing out what you believe is an ideal balance between the orbit
levels you've defined. There's no right or wrong answer, but here are some of
the things to optimize for.

### Mentoring

Between two levels, what balance will lead to an optimal amount
of supporting and mentoring? How many Contributors can an Advocate support and mentor?
Think about this between each pair of levels. A community is stronger and more scalable
if support and mentoring are happening between members one level apart vs. all mentorship
coming from the center.

### Growth

If growth is a goal of your community, think about the ratios that will
make growth sustainable. If your goal is to grow the overall community by 200%, think
about how many Advocates and Contributors it will take to support an influx of Participants and Explorers.

### Work

Some communities have a clear idea of how much work, and what kind of work, needs
to be completed for the community to succeed at its mission. If that's the case for you, think about
how many members are needed at each level and what their specific contributions will be. An open
source project may know that it needs a handful of core team members (Advocates) and a few dozen
Contributors (reviewing and merging PRs) to support hundreds of Participants (opening issues and asking questions) and thousands of Explorers
(reading docs and content).
