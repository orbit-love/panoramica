# Contributing to panoramica

:wave: First off, thank you so much for stopping by and visiting the Panoramica contributing guide - we're so happy to see you!

We understand that it may not always be very straightforward when making contributions to open source projects, so we're here to help you out!

If you're new to the world of making open source contributions, we recommend making small changes at first to any project that interests you just to get comfortable with the overall process of creating and submitting PRs (pull requests).

As you get more and more comfortable with those small changes, you'll find that you start building your contributing skills over time. :tada:
